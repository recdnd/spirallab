[Weight] ★☆☆☆☆
[Abstract] This card tests the behavior of Spiral Loader when the [Citation] field refers to the card itself. The goal is to simulate semantic closure loops and observe whether recursive self-reference triggers registration fracture or index echo instability.
[Scope] 
- Detection of closed citation chains  
- Fragment registration loop test  
- Observation of trace redirection collapse  
- Simulated echo-memory inverse locking

[ResearchQuestion] What occurs when a citation references its own structural container? Can the Loader resolve a self-referential document without triggering overflow or reference ambiguity?
[Method] The [Citation] field is constructed to legally reference its own ID and title. A second-layer reference is embedded parenthetically, forming a synthetic citation loop.

[+Layer: Expected Module Response]
- Arc: Warns with `[FRACTURE::CITATION::SELF]` and disables citation tracking  
- Machine: Attempts to resolve local fragment → enters `[loop(self)]`  
- Rec: May override ID reference as null origin `∅`
